            <h1>On-line Tutorials from Mike Dane</h1>
            <p>
                It was during my second year of my B.Tech(2020) and some of my friends are learning python 
                and I wanted to learn it too. So I opened YouTube and searched for python tutorials for 
                beginners. And one video from freecodecamp appeared on top of my search results and 
                I downloaded that one and that was when I learned python for the first time.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There the instructor named Mike Dane has taught me <a href="https://youtu.be/rfscVS0vtbw" target="_blank">python</a>  in a very beginner-friendly way. 
                So, it took me a week to understand what he taught and got a basic idea of python programming language.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also after that,  I refreshed my <a href="https://youtu.be/KJgsSFOSQv0" target="_blank">C language</a>  basics from the same guy and same freecodecamp channel 
                as he teaches in a simple and easy to grasp manner and I loved it. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Followed by a <a href="https://youtu.be/kJ0PKUMWnQI" target="_blank">java tutorial</a>  and also done with a <a href="https://youtu.be/vLnPwxZdW4Y" target="_blank">C++ tutorial</a>  from him. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This was one of the beginner mistakes I tried to learn many languages. And end up confused with syntax and 
                so by the end I stick with the last language I learnt i.e. C++.
                And I liked C++ as it was the same as C language and easy to understand.
