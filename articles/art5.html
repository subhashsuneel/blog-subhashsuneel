            <h1>Practicing Algorithms – HackerRank and Leetcode</h1>
            <p>
                It's placement season(second half of 2021), 
                before that I didn’t know anything about coding problems, these test cases, 
                coding interviews.
            </p>
            <h2>Where it was all started.</h2>
            <p>
                During the start of the placements, I was scrolling randomly on LinkedIn and I 
                found a post which was shared by my classmate linking to <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">hackerrank.com</a>  
                I click on that web URL and had a look for HackerRank for the first time and 
                created an account. Started writing “Hello World” in python and later slowly started solving some problems on the website.
                It was fun trying to get stars.
            </p>
            <h2>5 stars.</h2>
            <p>
                So my interest improved over time and I used to code on HackerRank to solve some basic problems using python.
                And also started other languages and finally felt comfortable with C++ and I solved problems until I got 5 stars.
                 Also after that, I solved basic algorithms using C++ and got 5 stars in the Problem-solving section.

            </p>
            <h2>Leetcode.</h2>
            <p>
                I was watching videos on YouTube about software engineering, software companies, 
                regarding the jobs and day in life videos of software engineers.
                 And I see many of them always talk about this platform called leetcode.com and So, I created an account. 
                 And started solving leetcode problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, I will do more problems, and try to do it consistently 
                as it helps to get into big tech companies in future.
