            <p>
                freeCodeCamp is an excellent website
                I discovered their website after watching their YouTube tutorials. 
                <i><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">Know more about freeCodeCamp.</a></i>
            </p>
            <p>
                And went to their website and had seen courses that can be learnt interactively. 
                So I started doing their Responsive web design course. It was a lot of fun doing those. 
                The entire learning and practice can be made on a single browser window.
            </p>
            <p>
                And it helped in re-learning the HTML and CSS and 
                also this time I learned and implemented it right away. 
                And done projects like tribute page, 
                Form, 
                product landing page, 
                Technical documentation page and portfolio page 
                in order to get a certificate from that course. 
            </p>
            <p>
                And I love the community behind it. 
                I follow them on  <a href="https://twitter.com/freeCodeCamp">Twitter</a> , <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/school/free-code-camp/">LinkedIn</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Freecodecamp">YouTube</a> as they teach great tech skills 
                through their <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/">blog</a>  and tweets and a vast amount of YouTube tutorials.
