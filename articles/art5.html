            <h1>Practicing Algorithms ‚Äì HackerRank and Leetcode</h1>
            <p>
                It's placement season(second half of 2021), 
                before that I didn‚Äôt know anything about coding problems, these test cases, 
                coding interviews.
            </p>
            <h2>Where it was all started.</h2>
            <p>
                During the start of the placements, I was scrolling randomly on LinkedIn and 
                found one post which was shared by my classmate that somehow landed on my feed 
                I click on that web URL and had a look for HackerRank for the first time and 
                created an account. Started writing ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù in python and later slowly started solving some problems on the website.
                It was fun trying to get stars.
            </p>
            <h2>5 stars.</h2>
            <p>
                So my interest improved over time and I used to code on HackerRank to solve some basic problems using python.
                And also started some other languages and stopped as many suggested to stick with one language 
                And I took that advice and felt comfortable with C++ and I solved them until I got 5 stars and felt happy 
                and posted that one on LinkedIn. Also after that, I solved basic algorithms using C++ and got 5 stars in the Problem-solving section. 
                And for the problem-solving section, there is also a 6th star to achieve but it was hard so I procrastinated.

            </p>
            <h2>Leetcode.</h2>
            <p>
                I was watching videos on YouTube about software engineering and software companies, 
                regarding the jobs and day in life videos of software engineers, 
                and other stuff which I was not needed. And many of them always talk about this platform
                 called leetcode.com and one day I created an account. 
                 And stopped the HackerRank and decided to solve leetcode problems. 
                 And I cant able to do those consistently and procrastinated for days and months.üòë
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, I will do more problems, and try to do it consistently 
                as it helps to get into big tech companies in future.
