            <h1>Diploma 4th semester – C language subject.</h1>
            <p>It was in 2017 when I was in my diploma 4th semester, 
            I had a subject named Programming in C and MATLAB. 
            <i>(As per C-16 regulation, Andhra Pradesh, India)</i> 
            </p>
            <p>And there was when I first started to get introduced to programming. 
                There is not so much learning and practical stuff. 
                They taught us some programming concepts in the C language.
                The syllabus at that time consists of 5 chapters. 
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>C Programming Basics</li>
                <li>Conditional statements and Arrays.</li>
                <li>Strings, Functions & pointers.</li>
                <li>Stuctures & unions.</li>
                <li>Basics of MATLAB.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>And the story was like any other college subject 
            we used to study and write our tests and get passed</p>

            <p>And coming to the interesting part we are taken to laboratories 
                once every week to practice C language on old blue colour nostalgic 
                IDE’s and me and many used to see our lab manuals and just copy-paste the code, 
                compile and run the program and show to our instructor and rest of the time 
                we used to have fun with friends. And all I have done. 
                Just came to know some basics of some programming terms.
